# Lab 4 Embedded Systems
This lab goes through the process of generating a PWM signal and measuring it vs its calculated value. Also goes through the process of blinking the green led.

To use these examples, load up Code Composer Studio and copy the file or file contents for the respective question and run the code on your own MSP430FR2355. To see the results a oscilloscope must be used on pin 1.6 to view the PWM signals being generated for questions 2 and 3. Question 1 blinks and led so the results can be visually seen.
